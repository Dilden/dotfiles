# dotfiles
It's like, the same as every other dotfiles repo but mine I guess?

## Vundle
Install [ Vundle ](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) via Git for package management

## TODO
* install.sh script for setting up all the goods
* automate adding sym link to ~/.vimrc (ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vimrc ~/.vimrc)
* find auto-closing brackets plugin
* php autocomplete
* html + css autocomplete
* sass/scss build system function
* better project searches (FZF?), ST3 has handy 'search all files in folder' feature that shows occurences of search term
